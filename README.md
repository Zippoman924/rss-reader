# rss-reader
This is a simple Java project to help get myself familiar with the language again. The goal of this project is to be a simple RSS Reader app with a few features. 

### Possible Features (Thanks ChatGPT)

1. **Multiple Feed Support:**
   - Allow users to subscribe to and manage multiple RSS feeds.
   - Implement the ability to add, remove, and organize feeds.

2. **Categorization:**
   - Enable users to categorize feeds into different groups (e.g., News, Technology, Sports).
   - Display feeds organized by categories.

3. **User Interface:**
   - Create a user-friendly console-based interface for displaying feed items.
   - Include options to navigate through different feed items and categories.

4. **Offline Mode:**
   - Implement a caching mechanism to store the fetched feed items locally.
   - Allow users to read feeds even when they are offline.

5. **Filtering and Sorting:**
   - Provide options to filter and sort feed items based on different criteria, such as date, relevance, or keyword.
   - Implement search functionality to find specific articles.

6. **Mark as Read/Unread:**

10. **Error Handling:**
    - Implement robust error handling to handle network issues, feed parsing errors, and other potential problems gracefully.
    - Display helpful error messages to users.

11. **Data Persistence:**
    - Save user preferences, feed subscriptions, and read/unread status to a local file for persistence between sessions.

12. **Security:**
    - Ensure secure handling of feed data, especially if fetching feeds from external sources.
    - Implement measures to prevent security vulnerabilities, such as code injection.

13. **Integration with External APIs:**
    - Explore integrating with third-party APIs to enrich feed items with additional information, such as article summaries or images.

14. **Testing:**
    - Implement unit tests to ensure the reliability of the feed reader.
    - Consider automated testing for different aspects of the application.

15. **Documentation:**
    - Provide clear documentation on how to use the feed reader, including setup instructions and troubleshooting tips.

Remember to start with a basic version and gradually add features to make the project more manageable. This way, you can focus on one aspect at a time and see the incremental progress of your RSS Feed Reader.
